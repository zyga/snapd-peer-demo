hooks:
    # The install hook is there to ensure that

    # Snapd currently lacks the language to describe that
    # declaratively. The hook simply disables the service.
    install:
    # The connect and disconnect hooks on the "peers" plug fire after
    # successful connection and disconnection, respectively. The connect hook
    # uses snapctl to start the peer-helper service, which can do background
    # processing on, for example, data provided by the peer. The disconnect
    # hook is less sophisticated and just logs the activity. Both hooks work to
    # maintain state describing the set of connected peers.
